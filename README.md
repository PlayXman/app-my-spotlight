Browser's new tab page extension
================================
Your own start page. Simplify your new tab and home page in your favorite web browser.

The project is designed to be fully open-sourced and developed by the users. You're more than welcome to contribute with a fix, new translation, or a new feature.  You can always describe the problem or idea in a new ticket. The community will then take care of its resolution.

If you don't want to use the public instance you can always run your own. The how-to guide can be found below.

### ‚≠êFeatures
